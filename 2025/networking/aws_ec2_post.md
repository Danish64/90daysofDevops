Launching an EC2 instance on AWS is simple, and you can use the **Free Tier** with **t2.micro** and **Amazon Linux 2**.

1. **Sign in** to AWS and open the EC2 Dashboard.
2. **Launch an instance** by selecting a Free Tier AMI, instance type, and storage.
3. **Configure security groups** to control traffic (e.g., allow SSH on port 22, HTTP on port 80).
4. **Review and launch** your instance, then create/download a key pair for SSH.
5. **Connect via SSH** using the key pair.

**Security groups** act as firewalls, allowing or blocking traffic based on rules. Restrict access to trusted IPs to enhance security.
