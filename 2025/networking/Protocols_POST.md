**Commonly Used Protocols and Ports in DevOps Workflow**

In DevOps, understanding protocols and ports is key to seamless communication. Here are the most common ones:

- **HTTP/HTTPS (Port 80/443)**: Web servers, APIs, and tools like Jenkins or GitHub.
- **SSH (Port 22)**: Secure remote access to servers and configuration management.
- **FTP/SFTP (Port 21/22)**: File transfers between systems, with SFTP being the secure choice.
- **SMTP (Port 25)**: Sending email alerts and notifications.
- **DNS (Port 53)**: Resolving domain names to IPs, e.g., in Kubernetes or cloud setups.
- **MySQL (Port 3306) & PostgreSQL (Port 5432)**: Database connections for apps and monitoring.
- **Kubernetes API (Port 6443)**: Managing and deploying applications in Kubernetes clusters.

**Real-World Example**:

1. Push code to GitHub (HTTPS, 443).
2. Jenkins (8080) builds the application and packages it into a Docker image.
3. The Docker image is pushed to a container registry (HTTPS, 443).
4. Kubernetes (6443) pulls the image and deploys the app to the cluster.
5. SFTP (22) is used to transfer configuration files or scripts to a remote server for setup.
6. Prometheus (9090) and Grafana (3000) monitor the application's performance.
7. Alerts are sent via SMTP (25) if issues arise.

Mastering these protocols and ports ensures efficient and secure DevOps workflows!
