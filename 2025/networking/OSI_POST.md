**Understanding the OSI Model with a Real-World Example**

The OSI model breaks networking into 7 layers. Here’s how it works when you browse a website:

1. You type **google.com** (Application Layer).
2. Data is encrypted via **HTTPS** (Presentation Layer).
3. A session is established (Session Layer).
4. **TCP** ensures reliable delivery (Transport Layer).
5. **IP** routes data to Google’s server (Network Layer).
6. **Ethernet/Wi-Fi** handles local transmission (Data Link Layer).
7. Data travels via cables or wireless signals (Physical Layer).

The OSI model simplifies networking and ensures seamless communication!
